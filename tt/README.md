# Dev-Health

## Problem
- Arthritis, poor digestion, back pain, and increased risk of cardiovascular disease are all associated with prolonged improper posture
- 86% of American workers have sedentary jobs that essentially foster poor posture
- In addition, people can develop poor posture through common day-to-day activities such as watching TV, driving, and using their cell phone

## Our Solution
- We created DevHealth to help tech workers avoid succumbing to poor posture. Sitting and coding in front of a computer screen for several hours on end can, over time, lead to severe health consequences.
- DevHealth runs in the background on your computer and analyzes changes in your posture. If you are shifting into poor posture, DevHealth notifies you of this by playing an alert bell sound. 

## A Bright Future
- We worked on a “tint” feature that tinted the user’s screen to a certain degree of redness depending on how long they held poor posture. The intention was to make it increasingly difficult for them to see the screen in order to prevent them from holding poor posture for too long. 
- However, we couldn’t implement the feature on time because we had trouble getting the necessary computer privileges to dim the screen, which we later found out was a known issue with Electron.
- We also want to continue spreading awareness on the health hazards of long-term improper posture. We believe our product should be used at every company because it can help the significant amount of workers working sedentary jobs avoid posture-related health complications.
